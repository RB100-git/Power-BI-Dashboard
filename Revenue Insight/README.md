# Insights For Revenue Growth in Hospitality Domain
A Data Analytics Project for Reviving Market Share and Revenue in Hospitality Industry through Business and Data Intelligence. Here's the problem statement:

AtliQ Grands(Hypothetical) owns multiple five-star hotels across India. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide these insights. Their revenue management team had hired a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
