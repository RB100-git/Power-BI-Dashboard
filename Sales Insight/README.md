2) ***Tabular form of profit contribution %, total profit margin % and revenue*** -->The company should try to give special benefits to *Electricalsara Stores* and *Excel stores* as they are their most profitable customers.

3) ***Revenue contribution % by market and Profit contribution % by Markets*** -->To understand about markets, how is each contributing in the over all revenue and over all profit, this comparative study will pave the way to understand the data in much more better way. Consider making a sales strategy for *Lucknow* since it is showing lowest revenue and negative profit margin and if possible so as for *Surat* and *Bhubhaneshwar* also.

4) ***Revenue by product*** -->The company should start their target campagin for *Prod047* and *Prod061* since they two are the most profitable and most selling products.

5) ***Profit contribution % by customer type*** -->To know which type of customers are contributing more so that in future the company can provide some customized offers to particular customer types on particular products to improve the sales further.
